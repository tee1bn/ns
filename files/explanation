balance of 200$ on 1,2,3,4,6 
balance of 100$ on subscription update


okay  

so we have maybe 2 pools one gold and one silver.

the users who earns a gold coin have access to gold and silver pool
the users who earns a silver coin, have access to the silver pool

60% of 0,3 of disagio goes in gold pool and 40% in silver pool
60% of the 20% setup fee goes in gold pool and 40% in silver pool
60% of 13% sales packages goes in gold pool and 40% in silver pool.

users who have 5 direct sales agents, 5 in-direct merchants and 100 sales agents in here hole network, gets one gold coin for every 100 sales agents in there network. so if he have 200 sales agents he will get 2 gold coins. if he have 2 he gets 2 shares of the gold and silver pool

if the user pays the professional package for 6 monthes he will get a silver coin. and every 6 month without break he will get a silver coin. with 1 silver coin he have 1 share of the silver pool

do you understand?
