Good morning,,

So here it is:

Example:

A users see our advertisement or hears from a friend 
He logs on to  our portal.

Now he sees 3 schemes for example
Non refundable signup fee of 

3₹ , 9₹ & 21₹

Each signup fee promises u that you will be given a platform or setup which will make you earn certain amount respectively.

Now user selects the 3₹ scheme
He pays the non refundable signup fee

A deliverable pdf file will be available instantly where instructions will be there. 

The exommerce part wont be visible to audience it will be hidden 

Certain payment link for the product will only be available when the user click ok the link given in the pdf 

Thats the part 1

Now 

The users will be allowed to make a chain and bring people to signup

Each signup will give them 10% commission and every 12 signups will reward them.
( THE CHAIN SYSTEM)

The user should be able to invite other users by generating the invite link or a refrence code 

The total population of india is 1.3 billion approx

And all the citizens want to earn free money by doing less work or something like this scheme

I have an example where people earned million illegally 
But this project will be legal because i have 3 real ways to make people earn.
